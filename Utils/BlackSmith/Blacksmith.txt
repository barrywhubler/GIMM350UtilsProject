Press Start(menu) to pause(unpause) the game (the 'P' key on the keyboard will also pause).  
While the game is paused press A button(or key to save)  and press B button(or key) to load.  
It saves and loads the swords and their attack values and positions, (but not angles... don't ask).
It is AWESOME give it a shot.  
I would suggest standing in one spot, and turning with the analog stick on the right controller, for the superb play expierience.
You have to lose all of you ore to lose the game, it's kind of hard to do... now that there are walls. 
However you can still throw all of the ore out of the window to bring up the game over screen. 
And to win Hang a completed sword up on the weapon rack (on the other sine of the wall  that has the instructions on it.
Enjoy!

Seriously the save is AWESOME... I will probably cry if you guys don't try it.

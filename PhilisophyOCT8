I did want to have some choice elements in my Blacksmith game, that would effect the surrounding world.  
Just kind of a message of like even though you are not the hero your actions can still help shape the world.  
I want the player to be able to deal with the demon army ("bad guys") for a financial advantage  and that would have negative consequences for the village.
However if you are just making supplies for heroes and the human armies, maybe some night an mortally wounded orc (or something) will come knocking at your door begging you to take care of it's baby.
It would be interesting to give the demon king like a really positive endgoal, like wanting to bring peace to beings in this fantasy world.

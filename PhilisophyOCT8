I did want to have some choice elements in my Blacksmith game, that would effect the surrounding world.  
Just kind of a message of like even though you are not the hero your actions can still help shape the world.  
I want the player to be able to deal with the demon army ("bad guys") for a financial advantage  and that would have negative consequences for the village.
However if you are just making supplies for heroes and the human armies, maybe some night an mortally wounded orc (or something) will come knocking at your door begging you to take care of it's baby.
How about a "am I the hero?" questline where the player can decide to try to save the kingdom themselves, and then immediatly gets shot and dies, because they are not the hero, they are a blacksmith.

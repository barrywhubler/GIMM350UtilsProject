//DELEGATES

//First you declare the delegate, then you create a delegate field
//You want to make sure The field is not null, because if it is, you will get an error.
//So it Seems to me that a delegate is like a variable that you put functions or methods into. 
//So when you call the delegate it performs the functions inside of it

 The Scope 

The Scope of the Game, for now, really scales things back, but it is also the main part of the game, 
becuase at this point of the game the level being worked on will just be the part of the game where you are black smithing.  
So I will need to set up the blacksmithery, and all the main tools in there, which will be a lot of work, but I won't be working 
on the mining parts of the game for right now.  If I can finish the sword making part early, I might go ahead and work on the 
customer service part of the game.  With the VR the user will be surrounded by all the sparks  and fire of a blacksmith shop 
without bbeing in actual dander of perishing in a smelting accident.  That makes me think, I'm really going to have to make those 
fire effects look amazing.
